# ScoreDraft

ScoreDraft is a music/singing synthesizer that provides a Python based 
score authoring interface. 

Currently, it includes the following synthesizer engines:

* Instrumental
	- SimpleInstruments: simple mathemtatic functions like sine-waves
	- KarplusStrong: guitar simulator using pure algorithm
	- BasicSamplers: tones generated by sampling one or multiple waveform samples
	- SoundFont2
* Percussion
	- BasicSamplers
	- SoundFont2 (GM Drums)
* Voice
	- VoiceSampler: a PSOLA-like algorithm is used to sample voice samples. A front-end "UtauDraft" is provided making it compatible to existing UTAU voice banks.

The framework is open and can be easily extended.

A PCM Player is provided to playback and visualize generated waveforms.

A more sophisticated visualizer "Meteor" is provided to visualize the notes/beats/syllables where the music is generated from.

The following example shows how easily a piece of musical sound can be generated using ScoreDraft.

```Python

	import ScoreDraft
	from ScoreDraft.Notes import *
	
	doc=ScoreDraft.Document()
	
	seq=[do(),do(),so(),so(),la(),la(),so(5,96)]
	
	doc.playNoteSeq(seq, ScoreDraft.Piano())
	doc.mixDown('twinkle.wav')

```


## Installation
ScoreDraft is now available from PyPi. Windows x64/Linux x64 supported.

```
pip install scoredraft
```

## Samples & Voice Banks

To avoid causing troubles, ScoreDraft now only includes a minimal set of instrumental/percussion samples to support the tests. The PyPi package doesn't include any of these.

ScoreDraft indexes the samples and banks by searching specific directory where the python script is started.

* Directory InstrumentSamples: wav instrument samples
	- There can be sub-directories containing multiple wav samples defining a single instrument for different pitch ranges.
	- Optionally, a freq file can be provided to define the frequency of the sample tone.

* Directory PercussionSamples: wav percussion samples
* Directory SF2: SoundFont2 bank files
* Directory UTAUVoice: UTAU voice banks (as sub-directories)

Users need to help themselves to download and organize extra samples and voicebanks. Here are just some recommandations, which is what I do at my place.

* Instrument/Percussion wav samples:

* SoundFont2 Instruments

	- SynthFontViena: http://www.synthfont.com/

* UTAU
	- uta(Japanese): default voice-bank that comes with UTAU
	- TetoEng(English): https://kasaneteto.jp/en/voicebank.html
	- Ayaka(Chinese): https://bowlroll.net/file/53297
	- Ayaka2 (Japanese): https://bowlroll.net/file/69898

## Version History

ScoreDraft was my first Python project. There were some severe limitations for pythonic packaging and releasing.
As a result, there was no formal release before the Nov 2021 refactoring (version 1.0.0).

[SingingGadgets](https://pypi.org/project/singinggadgets/) was a refactoring attampt in 2018, 
which only partially solves the issues. 

After the Nov 2021 refactoring, ScoreDraft have all the benefits of both SingingGadgets and the old ScoreDraft.
Therefore, the SingingGadgets project is now closed.

* Nov 19, 2021. ScoreDraft 1.0.0
* Jun 16, 2018. SingingGadgets 0.0.3
